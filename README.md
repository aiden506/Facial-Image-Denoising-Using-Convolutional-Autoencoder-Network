## üìñ Overview

Noise in facial images significantly impacts the performance of face recognition systems, especially in outdoor or uncontrolled environments. This project presents a deep learning-based denoising method using **Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs)** to improve image quality prior to recognition. The solution is trained and evaluated on the **ORL face dataset**, serving as a robust preprocessing module for facial recognition pipelines.
